# MachineHack-Predict-Book-Price

Books are open doors to the unimagined worlds which is unique to every person. It is more than just a hobby for many. There are many among us who prefer to spend more time with books than anything else.

Here we explore a big database of books. Books of different genres, from thousands of authors. In this challenge, participants are required to use the dataset to build a Machine Learning model to predict the price of books based on a given set of features.
